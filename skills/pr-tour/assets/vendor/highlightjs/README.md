# highlight.js 11.12.0

The unmodified common-language browser bundle is vendored so generated guides
remain one offline HTML file. It runs locally in the browser; no Node.js or
package installation is needed to generate a guide. See `LICENSE` for BSD-3-Clause
terms; the builder also embeds that notice in each generated HTML.

To update, replace the bundle and license from a pinned official release, update
the version and hashes here and the embedded version in
[`build_guide.py`](../../../scripts/build_guide.py). Run the builder and syntax
tests plus the browser tests in Chromium and WebKit, and rebuild the examples.
The repository [build instructions](../../../../../README.md#build-and-contribute)
list the commands. Keep the license notice when redistributing the bundle.

Language selection uses file extensions in `assets/syntax.js`. Unsupported files
remain plain text. Tokenization is separate from authored definition links and
does not imply that the guide can resolve every symbol.
